# CSCI-480
This is a repository I will be using to store all my CSCI 480 Principles of Operating Systems coursework. I have initially made this private as I do not want others in the class using my work.

## Assign 1
This assignment is just practice using basic system commands in C++ that work on Linux based operating systems. Such commands include:

* `fork()`
* `wait()`
* `system()`

## Assign 2
This builds on what was learned in the first assignment and adds the usage of `pipe()`.

## Assign 3
A simulation of a microshell. The shell should give a prompt `480shell>` and accept two commands that can be piped using the special character `||`, example: `480shell> cat ourfile || grep DeKalb` should return the expected `DeKalb`.

Included "ourfile" is a plaintext file to test using the shell with.
